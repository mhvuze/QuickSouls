# QuickSouls
========
Simple quicksave utility for Dark Souls (PC), written in C#. Press hotkey to do a quicksave, leave to main menu if you want to reload and press hotkey to restore quicksave.

Important
--------
* While there shouldn't be any issues like accidental savedata loss, you use this tool at your very own responsibility.
* No idea if this causes issues with the online component of the game, I never used nor cared for it.
* Try installing .NET Framework 4.5 if some features do not work for you, that's the target framework I used.

Notes
--------
* Modifier hotkeys do not work properly for the time being, so be aware of that.
* If you compile yourself, place sound.wav into the executable directory.
* Deleting QuickSouls.ini should resolve any issues with the tool configuration.
